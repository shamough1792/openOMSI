//! How the body of an AI vehicle follows the way its planner lays out
//! (`traffic::AiState::way_point`): a road vehicle is a bicycle model steered by pure
//! pursuit and sitting on its springs, a rail vehicle rides on its two outer axles, an
//! aircraft flies along its path and banks into its turns.
//!
//! Placing the vehicle *on* the lane every frame, turned to the lane's heading, is what made
//! the traffic look wrong: the heading jumped at every lane sample and joint (the steering
//! was worked out from those jumps), the body turned about its middle so that the rear
//! wheels slid sideways through every bend, and a lane change was a sideways glide with a
//! made-up yaw. Here the heading only ever changes by speed × tan(steering) / wheelbase,
//! the rear axle never moves sideways, and the steering itself is rate limited.
