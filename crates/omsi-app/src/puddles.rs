//! Puddle splashes: what a wheel throws up crossing standing water. The puddle itself - the
//! glass-flat, reflective patches on a wet `[moisture]` road, with the raindrop ripples
//! crossing it - is `enhanced.wgsl`'s; this file only works out *where* one sits (the same
//! low-frequency mask, evaluated here so a wheel can be asked whether it stands in one) and
//! spawns the spray as the renderer's smoke particles: soft, lit by the scene, blended - a
//! mist of water that widens and thins out. (Drawn as corona sprites before, the spray was
//! rings of glowing light flying off the wheels.)
