"""Sorts a new or edited issue, for .github/workflows/issue_triage.yml.

* Topic: the forms' "What is it about?" answer becomes a label (`area: ...`), swapped when
  the answer is edited.
* Milestone: a new issue without one gets the milestone its kind and topic belong to (see
  the milestones' descriptions); a bug that worked in an earlier version is a regression
  and goes to v0.1.x. Only when the issue is opened, so a maintainer's choice stays.
* Crashes: a report with a Rust panic in it is labelled `crash`. When an open issue already
  has the same panic (the same place in the same file, the same message), a report made by
  the game's "Report on GitHub" is closed as its duplicate and the original is told about
  it; when that issue was closed, the report gets a pointer to it and stays open.

Run as a script it reads the issue from $GITHUB_EVENT_PATH and acts through the `gh` CLI
($GH_TOKEN, $GH_REPO). With `--dry-run` it only prints what it would do.
